|   :----:    |    :----:   |
|  (0, 24]    |     20%     |
| (24, 48]    |     40%     |


**For example**
- Deadline: Feb. 8th, 11:59 PM
- Homework submission timestamp: Feb. 10th, 9:00 AM (<= 48 hours)
- Original points a student got: 10 points
- Actual point the student have: 10 x (1 - 40%) = 6 points

It is usually better if students just turn in what they have in time.
